    Modeling and simulation of autonomous vehicles plays a crucial role in achieving enterprise-scale realization that aligns with technical, business and regulatory requirements. Contemporary trends in digital lifecycle treatment have proven beneficial to support simulation-based-design (SBD) as well as verification and validation (V\&V) of these complex systems. Although, the development of appropriate fidelity simulation models capable of capturing the intricate real-world physics and graphics (real2sim), while enabling real-time interactivity for decision-making, has remained a challenge. Nevertheless, recent advances in AI-based tools and workflows, such as online deep-learning algorithms leveraging live-streaming data sources, offer the tantalizing potential for real-time system-identification and adaptive modeling to simulate vehicle(s), environment(s), as well as their interactions. This transition from static/fixed-parameter “virtual prototypes” to dynamic/adaptable “digital twins” not only improves simulation fidelity and real-time factor, but can also support the development of online adaption/augmentation techniques that can help bridge the gap between simulation and reality (sim2real). In such a milieu, this work focuses on developing autonomy-oriented digital twins of vehicles across different scales and configurations to help support the streamlined development and deployment of Autoware Core/Universe stack, using a unified real2sim2real toolchain. Particularly, the core deliverable for this project was to integrate the Autoware stack with AutoDRIVE Ecosystem to demonstrate end-to-end task of mapping an unknown environment, recording a trajectory within the mapped environment, and autonomously tracking the pre-recorded trajectory to achieve the desired objective. This work discusses the development of vehicle and environment digital twins using AutoDRIVE Ecosystem, along with various application programming interfaces (APIs) and human-machine interfaces (HMIs) to connect with the same, followed by a detailed section on AutoDRIVE-Autoware integration. Furthermore, this study describes the first-ever off-road deployment of the Autoware stack, expanding the operational design domain (ODD) beyond on-road autonomous navigation.\\
